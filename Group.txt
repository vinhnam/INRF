Work Assignment:
We all both have to read about 2nd HMM and Viterbi Algorithm.
After that, we created a shared project on Git so that everyone could view, check out/in and contribute into build tagger library.
We also created an extra project (based on Window WPF to make it interactable).
In total, we have 1 project for UI and 1 project as tagger library.
